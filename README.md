This is the source code for my personal blog, available at [philipfabianek.com](https://philipfabianek.com).

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme.

Things which I added:

- Giscus comment system
- Newsletter subscription form using MailerLite
- Analytics
- LaTeX support
- Automated hooks with Husky that update `pubDatetime` and `modDatetime`
- Modified external link behavior with `target="_blank"` and an arrow icon
